# Only-HTML-userstyle-for-Gmail
Attempt of Gmail's old HTML-only mode

Gmail, but like the old HTML-only mode. <b>With some flaws in the configuration buttons</b>.

This attempt at HTML-only mode obviously doesn't meet the basic requirements of such a mode. Since elements are only hidden, not removed.

The heavy use of styles can cause slowdowns on some devices.
